 * This is (mostly) the OpMode used in the goBILDA Robot in 3 Days for the 24-25 Into The Deep FTC Season.
 * https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpytbFEB5mLcWxf6rOHqbmYjDi9BbK00p&si=NyQLwyIkcZvZEirP (playlist of videos)
 * I've gone through and added comments for clarity. But most of the code remains the same.
 * This is very much based on the code for the Starter Kit Robot for the 24-25 season. Those resources can be found here:
 * https://www.gobilda.com/ftc-starter-bot-resource-guide-into-the-deep/
 *
 * There are three main additions to the starter kit bot code, mecanum drive, a linear slide for reaching
 * into the submersible, and a linear slide to hang (which we didn't end up using)
 *
 * the drive system is all 5203-2402-0019 (312 RPM Yellow Jacket Motors) and it is based on a Strafer chassis
 * The arm shoulder takes the design from the starter kit robot. So it uses the same 117rpm motor with an
 * external 5:1 reduction
 *
 * The drivetrain is set up as "field centric" with the internal control hub IMU. This means
 * when you push the stick forward, regardless of robot orientation, the robot drives away from you.
 * We "took inspiration" (copy-pasted) the drive code from this GM0 page
 * (PS GM0 is a world class resource, if you've got 5 mins and nothing to do, read some GM0!)

     * Mr. Morris:
     * This method is a finite state machine implementation to track the possible positions of the arm, slide, and wrist. The
     * main reason this was implemented is because Mahlon asked for a time delay when moving from the SCORE_SPECIMEN down. I
     * interpreted this as hitting the button to go to the COLLECT, however it could be adjusted to behave how the drivers want.
     * Currently it has a timer in the COLLECT case so that the arm delays half a second while the slide retracts. There are
     * certainly simpler solutions to this problem, but this one is more robust and gives us the framework to make all sorts of
     * fancy transitions between states while still being readable. The magic happens at the top of the while(opModeIsActive())
     * loop. It calls this method to update the arm state every loop. Later in the program buttons will change the currentState
     * and the next program loop when the method is called it will update the positions. By being called every program loop
     * regardless of button press it can track timers and even flow from one arm state to another if we want it to.
     * @param state This is an enum of ArmState type. enums are a way of creating a sort of list of options that can be chosen
     *              by name in a switch statement like this. This makes code more readable and less prone to errors. It is a
     *              description of a position the arm, slide, and wrist can be in (e.g. FOLDED, COLLECT, etc.)
